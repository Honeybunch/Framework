Framework
=========

A simple game framework and Pong example for experimenting with OpenGL 4 and GLSL written in C++.

Right now it's just a messy Visual Studio project. I'll eventually get around to turning this into a pretty CMake project. 

This is mostly for my own educations, but feel free to pick apart the source code however you wish. I probably won't accept contributions right now because it's still very much my project, but when I feel a bit more confident aobut it I'll probably start advertising this.
